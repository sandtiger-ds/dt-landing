      <p>Here's what some users of fancy money management apps are saying:</p>
      <p>"I'm fed up with [name of app/service] constant syncing issues: account balances not correct after reverifying credentials, accounts that constantly ask to be reverified every week, and many more...</p>
      <p>...the user experience has degraded... I don't need "cool" features like a Spotify-style "year in review". I just want the basic features to work. Has anybody... found something better?"</p>
      <p>Another user replies: "I don't want to break this to you but... they are all bad, so now the decision is which one is less bad."</p>

    <section class="faq container">
      <details>
        <summary>Does it connect to my bank?</summary>
        <p>No. For privacy and simplicity, Dollar Tracker is manual-entry. That means no syncing or data transmission issues and better awareness of your spending.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Is my data private?</summary>
        <p>Yes. Your data resides in your browser's storage and never leaves your device. Also, your data is directory dependant, so running DT from a different folder will not pull up the data you stored from your original run.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What platforms are supported?</summary>
        <p>Any OS running on a Linux, Apple, or Windows machine. Since DT is browser-based, it is machine/OS independant.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Is Dollar Tracker reliable?</summary>
        <p>Yes, as long as you run the html file from the same directory every time, your data will always be there.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can I use multiple instances of Dollar Tracker?</summary>
        <p>Yes. Just copy the files to a new directory and all the data will be reset for a new instance.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can I get a mobile version?</summary>
        <p>Dollar Tracker shines as a desktop app, but you could run it on a tablet or phone if you copied the files over and ran it from your mobile device's browser.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Is it easy to setup/install?</summary>
        <p>Actually, Dollar Tracker doesn't need any 'installation' per se, just copy the three web files to a folder and run index.html. Remember to run from the same folder the next time, since the browser will look for your data in that same location.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Is it easy to learn to use?</summary>
        <p>Dollar Tracker is very intuitive and easy to use, but to make it even easier, we do provide a text document that walks you through general usage in detail, and gets you up to speed fast.</p>
